With their luscious flavors and dazzling colors, these drinks capture the 1980s’ lavish, over-the-top aesthetic. Kat will kick things off with an eye-popping Blue Hawaiian, and then move on to a sophisticated Amaretto Sour and a sultry Tequila Sunrise. Along the way, you’ll learn tricks of the trade, like how to make your own grenadine and infuse simple syrup with the zing of fresh orange.

To really get into the groove, think about adding our 80s and 90s Hum the Song Game to your purchase of this class. It’ll challenge you to guess throwback tunes without hearing the lyrics, and Kat might even play a few rounds during class. Because ‘80s cocktails are all about fun, this experience makes an amazing gift and is also available as a private group event for prewedding parties, milestone birthdays, family gatherings, and more (see below for ordering help). Hot, cool & delicious drinks from the decade that fought for its right to party? You’ll have the time of your life.

Chef JD will share his own family recipes (plus vegan options) for two teas that are fragrant with  spices like anise, cardamom, and cinnamon—which you’ll find in the organic Chai Tea Kit that comes with your purchase of this class. JD will demonstrate expert brewing techniques that make the most delicious cup, and you’ll also discover more about the history of chai, Indian tea culture, and the health benefits traditionally attributed to the different spices.

Since we’re heading into the coziest time of year, this experience is wonderful to share with a friend, gift to a favorite couple, or give to anyone who loves Indian food and learning authentic recipes.

56729,Fika Feast: Swedish Cardamom Bread,"In Swedish, fika means “to have a coffee.” But in Sweden, fika is so much more than that. This daily (or sometimes twice a day) ritual provides a chance to slow down, socialize, and enjoy something sweet—like the traditional cardamom bread you’ll learn to make in this one-hour online class. 

Good company is essential to a real fika, so this experience is a delicious gift for your baking buddy or anyone you love taking a break with (and it’s also a delightful companion to our handmade Scandinavian Baking experience). Instructor Amy Hallstrom will walk you through the steps to baking a fragrant, cardamom-spiced braided loaf (a.k.a., kardemummabulle). You’ll just need milk, butter, and eggs (or their vegan alternatives), because the class comes with Amy’s own Swedish Cardamom Bread Kit, which includes all of the premeasured dry ingredients and Amy’s exclusive recipe, plus a pretty cotton tea towel and wooden butter knife.

You’ll make the bread dough before class so it can rise. Then, Amy will kick things off with expert advice on working with yeast breads as you roll out your prepped dough and braid it into that irresistible shape.

In its relatively short history the only significant change to this system occurred in 1925, when the markers switched styles, from indented to raised dates. By 1969, date nail use declined rapidly and today they survive as relics of an antiquated method of date keeping during the height of America's Industrial Revolution.

In order to turn these historical pieces into handsome shirt accents, the shank is milled down to create a post-style cufflink.

27303,Shakespearean Insults Chart,"We all know someone who deserves to be dubbed a ""penurious and indubitate beggar."" And from time to time, you may be tempted to say that ""he has not so much brain as ear-wax."" This rollicking infographic is chock-full of such colorful insults from Shakespeare, the playwright who practically invented the art of the poetic put-down. Designer Tim Sanders culled the Oxford Complete Shakespeare to compile an endlessly entertaining word map of the Bard's boisterous, bawdy jabs, each one a mini-masterpiece of raunchy, rancorous Renaissance wit. The four-color, offset-printed poster on 100 lb., acid-free, FSC-certified paper makes the perfect reference and decor for an astute office, library, or thespian lounge. Made in Seattle.

46062,Periodic Table of Presidents,"As our first President, George Washington was like hydrogen. Harrison's month-long Presidency was ended by a fatal virus. Ike was a well-known ""Rebounder."" American politics may not be an exact science, but Griffin Gonzales' innovative diagram draws on the iconic Periodic Table of Elements to present the history of the Presidency. Fascinated by Presidents since his third-grade obsession with Millard Filmore, Griffin now combines his study of government with self-taught design skills. Traditional line-ups of our 45 commanders-in-chief can be as dry as a chalk board, but Griffin's version offers a wealth of interpretation: political parties, historical eras, leadership traits, and terms in office. The Presidents are still shown sequentially, but by borrowing the scientific structure of the Periodic Table, they're also organized into columns that teach historical and political lessons. There are even subtle ""Easter egg"" details, like the fact that Presidents who died in office are facing left (RIP, Abe). The poster makes a proudly patriotic display for teachers, young scholars, and political junkies.

56481,Simmer Time: Chinese Hot Pot,"Hot pot may be the latest social media food sensation, but the history of this Chinese dish goes back at least 1,000 years. It wouldn’t be fair to call it a soup—hot pot is an interactive culinary experience that’s only limited by your imagination. Join social media star chef Shan of @CookingwithShanShan for a two-hour class where you’ll take a delicious deep dive into hot pot cooking.

Shan is passionate about sharing the authentic Szechuan cuisine that she learned from her parents and grandmother, and she's earned a devoted social media following for her enthusiastic teaching style. Before class, you’ll receive Shan’s extensive list of vegetarian ingredients—you’ll be able to choose up to 10 of them, or even bring your own favorites (that's where your imagination comes in). You’ll also have help from our Chinese Hot Pot Starter Kit, which includes two broth bases (spicy and mild) and noodles, plus savory and spicy sauces.

Shan will explain hot pot’s three essential elements: broth, the ingredients that will be cooked in it, and the dipping sauces. Together, you’ll prepare the raw ingredients, sauces, and broths. Then comes the heart of the hot pot tradition: cooking your ingredients in the simmering soups, dipping them, and relishing what you’ve made.

Hot pot is traditionally a communal event, so invite a friend, or gift this class to your favorite couple, family members, or anyone who loves to learn new recipes and ways to cook. After two hours with Shan, you’ll be a new devotee of hot pot and you’ll have learned a scrumptious, shareable experience that you can enjoy again and again.

56448,Academic Adventure: Graduation Mapmaking,"Okay, maybe you didn’t go to wizard school…or hey, maybe you did. Either way, everyone’s journey to graduation is the stuff of legend. Join us for a remarkable 90-minute online experience that will teach you to map the most magical realm of all: real life. Our guide on this quest is Brendan Lorber, a poet, writer, and artist whose fantastical biographical maps are on display in libraries and museums from Bed-Stuy to Edinburgh. Taking inspiration from classic fantasy fiction and role-playing games, Brendan’s imaginative style is uniquely suited to creating an extraordinary present for a friend or family member who’s about to graduate—and the class itself is an unforgettable gift to anyone who’s celebrating commencement.

Prior art experience is not required, but everyone will have some fun homework before class: listing the landmark events, passionate pursuits, and memorable moments that make up the history of their subject’s school days (these will become the map’s geographic features). Your map can cover multiple years—all of high school or college, for example—or focus on a specific period, like senior year. Once the lesson begins, Brendan will get right into it with engaging, practical instruction and plenty of time to work and ask questions. No worries about specialized supplies, since this class comes with our custom Fantasy Mapmaking Kit, which includes a template on artist-quality paper, a French curve drawing tool, Brendan’s own cartography guide, and more.

In an hour and a half, you’ll go from apprentice mapmaker to master cartographer as you create a mythic masterpiece worth cherishing for years—drawing new versions may even become a grad-season tradition. While you probably won't finish your work during class, Brendan will equip you with the skills to complete your map with confidence. As Brendan says, “Anyone can have a treasure map. In this class, you’ll be making maps that themselves are treasures.”

Before class, you must complete the Concepting Your Map project, outlined  here..

So it only makes sense that your garden ornament should follow suit. Enter Dieter Stipe's decorative object, composed of a mushroom-shaped spinner that gracefully balances on a squiggly stake.

55372,Auto-Dimming Responsive Head Lamp,"Headlamps provide hands-free task lighting for outdoor adventurers, garage-workshop tinkerers, and even music festivalgoers.

This works if the wearer simply tilts their head down, or if the light itself is tilted on the headband within its 120-degree vertical range.

Speaking of the headband, it’s a one-size-fits-all stretchy strap with adjustment options, if needed.

Maker Melanie Brauner enlists a unique technique to bring each one to life. First, she dips shaped metal into a pulp made from water and plant fibers. As the pulp dries, it forms a translucent, papery skin that builds up with each successive dip. This papier-mâché-esque process leads to a layered, three-dimensional result, which Melanie then hand-dyes and seals in resin. The final product? A gorgeous ombré pendant, which she then strings along a delicate, sterling silver chain.

22254,Equation Geek Clock,"Learning to tell time is so grade school. Indulge your inner geek and accept a new challenge with this nerdy clock. Each numerical hour of the day is spelled out with a different mathematical notation, giving you a new mathematical boost with each time check. For nascent mathematicians and victims of the occasional memory lapse, a cheat sheet is included with each clock:
1: i is equal to the square root of -1, so i^2= -1. The absolute value of -1 is 1.
2: This represents 2 in binary code.
3: The cube root of 27
4: 11 base 3, which represents 4 in the ternary system
5: Log(20x)=2 is equivalent to 20x=10^2 or 20x=100, where x=5. 
6: Euler's product formula: phi(p^k)=(p^k)(1-(1/p)), where (p^k)=9
7: This is a binomial coefficient, so with the formula n/k = (n!)/((k!)(n-k)!), n/k=7.
8: This is a natural logarithm where ln(e^x)=x, so ln(e^8)=8.
9: This summation is equal to 3(1)+3(2)=3+6=9.
10: Since clocks ""wrap around"" every 12 hours, the hour number starts over after it reaches 12. This is arithmetic modulo 12. 10mod12 is 10:00, and 16mod12 would be 4:00, for example.
11: B'L is Legendre's constant, which is equal to 1, so this equation becomes the square root of 121, which is 11. 
12: Hexadecimal representation of 12

53307,Heartwood The Art of Living with the End in Mind,"The modern world is uncomfortable with death, but when we turn away from our mortality, we also cast aside what it can teach us. In her candid memoir, award-winning author Barbara Becker eloquently addresses this most inevitable part of life.  When her oldest childhood friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer and living out her last year, Barbara embarked on a quest to write about how to live with an accepting awareness of death. Through remarkable honesty and lyrical storytelling, Barbara shows us that there are life-giving lessons in death and that grief itself is a pathway to healing, love, and enduring strength. She weaves a deeply personal narrative of end-of-life stories drawn from her own family, her experiences as an international human-rights advocate, and her work as a hospice volunteer at New York City's Bellevue Hospital. Along the way, we encounter extraordinary people and truths revealed at the place where life and death meet.   A compassionate gift for anyone living with loss, this chronicle invites us to experience a new and unguarded relationship with the dying, the dead, and death itself. Printed in the United States.
 ""In Heartwood, Barbara Becker inspires us to follow our curiosity into a world of love and loss that is both universal and a source of our uniqueness. And what could be better than that?""

53837,Couple's Personalized Heart Swing,"You had one when you were a kid and you could spend a whole summer afternoon on it, exhilarated by that nothing-else-like-it feeling of flying. Now that you’re all grown-up and you’ve met the person who makes your heart soar, it’s time to get back in the swing of things. Eddie Swedlund has combined his woodworking genius and training as an aerospace engineer to craft a romantic tree swing that’s as handsome as it is built to last.Eddie chose Brazilian walnut wood for the heart-shaped seat because it’s exceptionally strong and resistant to the elements—even to fire. He pairs it with durable pro Manila rope that is almost breakproof, yet easy on your hands, and comes pre-tied with the knot that holds the swing. Personalized with names and a meaningful year, this expertly designed piece is a playful way to celebrate your love and makes an imaginative anniversary or off-registry wedding present for a favorite couple.

54793,Best-Ever DIY Cavatelli + Fresh Tomato Sauce,"Tomatoes picked at the peak of the season make a sauce like nothing you'll ever find in a jar: delicate in texture, yet exquisitely flavorful and worthy only of the freshest homemade pasta. If you've relished this classic pairing at your favorite Italian restaurant, you may think it requires a chef's know-how. Nope: In this 90-minute class, you'll learn to whip up heavenly pasta and garden-fresh tomato sauce right in your own kitchen.
Longtime food instructor Sydney Wilcox will first teach you how to make the simple dough. While it rests, she'll show you how to turn those tomatoes into mouthwatering sauce (and if you don't have peak-season tomatoes on hand, no worries: Sydney's also a fan of heirloom or yellow tomatoes). Then you'll learn how to form your dough into cavatelli (that's Italian for ""little hollows""), a shell-shaped pasta that lovingly holds on to sauce. When the class ends, you'll have dinner ready to eat, and the skills to re-create this delectable dish on your own, anytime (lucky you).

54786,Paint Your Pet: Portrait Class,"You know and love every inch, hair, and adorable quirk of your pet. That's why—even without drawing skill or painting experience—you're the best artist to paint their portrait. Yes, really.

This 90-minute live online class led by Oklahoma artist Addie Stunkard starts with an introduction to the materials you’ll be using. To get the most out of the lesson (and save yourself a trip to the art supplies shop) we recommend: a pad of specialty paper, a palette of 24 watercolor paints, and two brushes. Addie will demonstrate basic painting techniques and then, using a black-and-white printer paper photo of your pet, you'll work in pencil to transfer (not trace) the outline onto watercolor paper. Finally, you'll color it in, putting to use the watercolor techniques you just learned. You will probably finish your pet portrait during the 90 minutes, but you may also want to leave time after the class to perfect your masterpiece—either way, it'll be worthy of fancier-than-the-fridge display!

In this 90-minute class, tarot mentor Holly Buczek will help turn these mysterious images into familiar friends by teaching you the basics of reading and interpreting them.

(The deck sells for $25 separately, but is included in the price of this class.) Some people think tarot cards predict the future, but really, they're powerful tools for tuning into your own intuition—and whatever type of inner wisdom you believe.

54801,Written in the Stars: Astrology Chart Class,"We humans have been studying how heavenly bodies affect our fates and fortunes for nearly 5,000 years—so you know there's a lot more to astrology than just checking your horoscope app. In this hourlong class,  leading astrologer Emily Klintworth will show you how to chart your unique astrological forecast for the next 12 months.  

A fascinating gift to yourself or anyone celebrating a birthday, the class taps into each participant's individual astrological profile. In fact, you'll need to know the date, place, and exact time of your birth in order to create your most accurate chart—so find your birth certificate, because if your birth time is even a few minutes off, you'll get an incorrect reading.  

  At the beginning of class, Emily will ask you to center on an intention for this birthday and the year ahead. With that in mind, you'll build your forecast using the chart and stickers included with the class. Emily's expert direction will help you identify patterns of celestial energy month by month and understand how they can affect you—there may be seasons where you need to be more active, for example, or others when you should slow down and practice self-care. By the end of the hour, you'll have a detailed astrological guide to help you navigate the coming year, and a deeper connection to your innate self, intuition, and potential. No wonder we've been at this for 5,000 years.

54863,Romantic Date Night Painting Class,"They say that being in love stimulates creativity. We like to think it also works the other way around. For your next date night, get in touch with your artistic and amorous sides in a 90-minute couples’ painting class that will transport you to the winding streets of Positano or Paris. Beginners, never fear: you don’t need any experience because you’ll be working with our Date Night Paint by Shadows Kit (usually $50, but included in the price of this class).

Art teacher Jennifer Funnell will start with an introduction to the materials in your kit. Next, she’ll share the essentials of working with acrylic colors, including how to mix pigments to create new shades, fill in large areas, and add personal touches. Then you’re free to brush away, with Jennifer ready to answer your questions as you go. Feel free to bring your favorite wine, bubbly, or cocktails, and perhaps a candle or two for ambiance—you can even make a playlist to listen to while you paint (with your Zoom muted, of course). 

This class is an imaginative way to celebrate an engagement, anniversary, or just a romantic evening at home, so it also makes a wonderful gift for any couple. You will probably finish your masterpiece during the 90 minutes, but you may also want to leave time after the class to continue painting...and to make those loving feelings last.

Experiences make great gifts! To gift this class, simply purchase the class for the date/time you think will work for your recipient. If that doesn’t work for the recipient, no worries! Send an email that includes your order confirmation number to help@uncommongoods.com at least 48-hours prior and we’ll help get them moved into a scheduled class that works better for them.

48759,Hot Toddy Kit,"Cinnamon. Honey. Piping hot water. A shot of whiskey. You know where this is going: the Hot Toddy. The drink we love to let warm us from the inside out originated in India, as a warm beverage made from fermented sap of the toddy palm. This version is more what you had in mind, and it comes with all the spices you need to brew the classic hot cocktail at home. 
 
Like the toddies that eventually made their way north through trade routes, the set includes cinnamon sticks and warming flavor combinations. The Lemon Ginger blend soothes with lemongrass, ginger, and lemon peel, while the Orange Clove blend features its title flavors and a hint of rich, calming roasted chicory. 

Each canister also contains three reusable muslin jute tea bags, to make steeping easy. Just add boiling water, a tablespoon of your favorite honey, and 2 oz. of whiskey, rum, or brandy to create a boozy (and delicious) tonic, or skip the last step to enjoy a non-alcoholic treat.

During this heroic flight, the hummingbird flew through a rainbow and it is believed that this is where it got its magnificent colors.

53497,Transcendent Nose Oil,"Today your nose breathed in oxygen, expelled carbon dioxide, filtered airborne impurities, and sniffed out the best coffee in the neighborhood. And what did you do for your nose? Exactly. Make it up to this hardworking organ with a few drops of cleansing, restorative oil. Inspired by the ancient Ayurvedic nasal treatment known as nasya, Dakota Hills and Sierra Brashear custom-blend their nose oil with botanicals that moisturize and protect delicate tissues (and smell wonderful too). Because Ayurvedic wisdom considers the nose the doorway of consciousness, nasya is also believed to promote mental clarity, relieve tension, and balance the body's elements.

To use, simply lie on your back and place three to five drops in each nostril. Inhale slightly through your nose and let yourself rest for five minutes. That sounds good all on its own, but you can also use the time to meditate, lightly massage your face, or just focus on your breathing. The oil is safe to use every day, and can be especially beneficial before yoga, meditation, or mindful breath work. Handmade in Colorado.

54993,Fantasy Mapmaking: Chart a Life Story,"While wizards are not in the habit of turning up at front doors these days (alas!), everyone’s story is still an epic adventure. Join us for a remarkable 90-minute online experience that will teach you to map the most legendary realm of all: real life. Our guide on this quest is Brendan Lorber, a poet, writer, and artist whose fantastical biographical maps are on display in libraries and museums from Bed-Stuy to Edinburgh. Taking inspiration from classic fantasy fiction and role-playing games, Brendan’s imaginative style is uniquely suited to creating an extraordinary present for a friend or family member—and the class itself makes an unforgettable gift, especially for someone celebrating a milestone birthday. 

Prior art experience is not required, but everybody will have some fun homework before class: listing the landmark events, passionate pursuits, and memorable moments that make up the history of their subject (these will become the map’s geographic features). Each map can cover a full life or focus on a specific time frame, such as the past year, college days, or that one amazing summer. Once the lesson begins, Brendan will get right into it with engaging, practical instruction and plenty of time to work and ask questions. No worries about specialized supplies, since this class comes with our custom Fantasy Mapmaking Kit, which includes a template on artist-quality paper, a French curve drawing tool, Brendan’s own cartography guide, and more. 

In an hour and a half, participants will go from apprentice mapmaker to master cartographer as they create a mythic masterpiece worth cherishing for years—drawing new versions may even become an annual tradition. While you likely won't finish your map in class, Brendan will equip you with the skills to complete your map with confidence. As Brendan says, “Anyone can have a treasure map. In this class, you’ll be making maps that themselves are treasures.” 


Before class, you must complete the Concepting Your Map project, outlined here.

In this 90-minute online watercolor class, you’ll learn to paint a frameworthy tableau of an elegant initial adorned with birth-month blooms and greens.

Next, you’ll work with a graphite transfer process to lay out the letter and flower of your choice (we’ll provide templates for both before the class). Then you’re free to paint away, using the skills you just learned, with Addie on hand to answer any questions. You’ll probably finish your masterpiece during the 90 minutes, but you may want to leave time after the class to add some final touches. The result is a beautifully personalized work of art for a special friend or family member, and the class itself makes an imaginative—and everlasting—birthday gift for anyone who loves exploring their creativity and trying something new.

55316,In the Pink: Ruby Chocolate Macaroons,"It’s believed that the first macaroons were the invention of medieval Italian monks, but other versions of the origin story trace the succulent sweet to a French convent, Syrian pastry chefs, and even a Philadelphia flour merchant who suddenly found himself with a surprise shipment of coconuts. The golden crisp, chewy morsels that are especially beloved for holiday celebrations have a long and luscious history—and you can learn the secrets to making them more delectable than ever. 
 
Join master New York City bakers Agathe, Joanne & Adriana for a one-hour online lesson where you’ll discover how to make coconut macaroons robed in exquisite ruby chocolate (nicknamed “the fourth chocolate,” it gets its pink hue and berry-tart flavor naturally, from young, unprocessed cocoa beans). You’ll only have to shop for eggs because this class comes with our Ruby Chocolate Macaroon Baking Kit, which has all of the premeasured dry ingredients you need. 

One of the bakers (Agathe, Joanne, or Adriana) will first show you a double-boiler hack to heat and blend the batter like a pro. Next, you’ll shape the macaroons and pop them in the oven, and share some confectionary Q&A with your instructor while they bake. Then you’ll learn techniques to cool the oven-fresh delicacies fast and expertly decorate them with a blush of ruby chocolate. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: indulging in the rich results of your work.

These coconutty delights are a special treat to bake on a snow day, for Valentine’s Day or date night, or as a springtime-hued spin on the time-honored Passover dessert (yep, the kit is kosher). The class makes an imaginative gift for a baking-buff friend, family member, favorite couple, or anyone who wants to learn a rosy new take on tradition.

55344,Hot + Homemade: Focaccia with Marinara Sauce,"Think about a night out at your favorite Italian restaurant—what are you looking forward to the most? It’s the bread, isn’t it? Warm, crusty focaccia dipped in rich marinara…yep, we get it. Now imagine enjoying the mouthwatering combo when it’s fresh from your own oven. In 90 minutes, chef Jannie Huang will teach you the secrets to making the flavorful flatbread and its saucy sidekick right at home.

This culinary class is a delicious gift for a dedicated carbivore, foodie, or anyone who loves to entertain at home. Jannie will demystify the process of proofing yeast and teach you to work with the dough to achieve focaccia’s much-loved texture. While the dough rises, you’ll prep and blend the ingredients for a zesty vegan marinara sauce and set that to simmer. Then, Jannie will show you how to shape your loaf and finish it like a pro with those signature dimples and a seasoning of olive oil, rosemary, and flaky sea salt.

As the incredible aromas of sauce and baking bread fill the kitchen, Jannie will share ways to use the versatile flatbread for pizza, sandwiches, and more. At last, the moment you’ve waited for: your focaccia comes out of the oven hot and chewy on the inside, golden-crisp on the outside, and all ready for a dip in that scrumptious sauce.

55438,Delhi Delights: Samosas & Coriander Chutney,"Samosas: You’ll find them wherever exquisite Indian food is being served, from family tables to sizzling food carts on New Delhi street corners to the most elegant restaurants. While there are many versions of the South Asian delicacy, the quintessential recipe calls for a masterful blend of potato and spices cooked in flaky pastry with a side of emerald-hued coriander chutney—and that’s exactly how you’ll learn to make the iconic dish in this 75-minute online class with Delhi native Chef JD.

Making (and eating!) samosas is twice as fun with a friend, so invite a buddy to this class or gift it to your favorite foodie couple, family, or anyone who loves expanding their culinary know-how. First, JD will show you how to prepare the delicate dough. While it’s resting, you’ll blend potatoes and seasonings into a flavorful vegetarian filling (that’s easy to make vegan), while JD shares expert tips on ways to incorporate Indian flavors into your cooking. Next, you’ll learn the secrets to transforming pastry and filling into those classic samosa triangles. JD will demonstrate deep-frying the pillowy pockets to golden-crisp perfection and explain alternate cooking methods, including baking and air-frying. While your samosas cool, you’ll combine fresh coriander and chilies into a brilliant sauce to serve alongside your creations.

Along the way, JD will answer your questions and share stories of growing up and learning to cook in a family that’s been part of Delhi’s restaurant scene for more than half a century. By the end of class, you’ll have a savory plate of samosas and chutney to enjoy and the skills to re-create this Indian favorite anytime the craving strikes.

55314,Charm School: Love Potion Cocktails,"When Shakespeare’s fairy king needed a love potion, he called for “a little western flower” that would make anyone “madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.” Sounds like that could get, um…complicated. If it’s romantic spells you’re after, join bartender Kat Olson for this 75-minute class where you’ll learn how to craft bewitching brews (a.k.a., cocktails) using flowers and herbs that have age-old associations with love.

These enchanting drinks are best made with someone you dote on (madly or otherwise), so this experience is an imaginative gift for a partner, favorite couple, or a bosom buddy who's keen on creative cocktailing. You’ll accelerate your mixed-drinks mastery with the Color-changing Love Potion Cocktail Kit that comes with this class. It includes conjuring elements like a glass beaker/jigger, real lavender buds, and an ingenious herbal blend that will transform your drinks into dazzling, color-changing spectacles. 

Kat will start the class with an introduction to the ingredients and explain the “language of flowers,” which lovers relied on for centuries to express sentiments that were too sweet—or secret—for words. Next, she’ll show you how to steep the botanicals and blend syrups as the base for three captivating concoctions (and their nonalcoholic versions): a brilliant Mood Ring Cocktail, a refreshing Rosemary Bay Leaf Gimlet, and an adult Lavender Lemonade. As you mix each drink, they'll ""magically"" burst into vivid shades of purple and blue until, at last, you'll test the potency of your potion with a zesty sip. When the 75 minutes are up, you’ll have added three delightfully different new recipes to your home-bar repertoire—and learned the secrets to stirring up some spirited sorcery of your own.

You’ll make and chill the simple dough before class, and then one of the bakers (Agathe, Joanne, or Adriana) will walk you through building the cookies, showing you how to seal the layers together and create the lemon-candy “glass” that's the key to the delightful shaker effect. When the cookies come out of the oven, you’ll decorate them together using the piping bag that’s included in your kit. After about an hour (to give the candy windows time to set), you’ll be able to shake them up and enjoy the sweet, homebaked magic—and all the oohs and aahs you’ll get when you post these eye-catching confections on your social media pages.

55565,Kaffe Society: Scandinavian Baking,"We're not sure who invented the coffee break, but we know that the Swedes have made an art of it. Their ""fika"" (it’s a noun and a verb) is a daily ritual of slowing down, socializing, and enjoying something sweet—like the baked goodies you’ll learn to make in this 75-minute online class.

Good company is essential to the fika way of life, so this experience is a delicious gift to your baking buddy or anyone you love taking a break with. Instructor Amy Hallstrom will walk you through the steps to making not one, but two Swedish faves: fragrant, cardamom-spiced cinnamon buns (a.k.a. “kanelbullar”) and melt-in-your-mouth shortbread cookies. For the buns, you’ll just need milk, butter, and eggs (or their vegan alternatives), because the class comes with Amy’s own Scandinavian Cinnamon Buns Kit, which includes all of the pre-measured dry ingredients, baking tools, and Amy’s exclusive recipe.

You’ll make the kanelbullar dough before class so that it can rise. Then, Amy will kick things off with her expert tips on working with yeast breads as you roll out your pre-prepped dough, fill it, and braid it into that irresistible shape. While the buns are on their second rise, you’ll make the cookies and pop them in the oven, followed by your perfectly risen cinnamon buns.

Kanelbullar and shortbread will both be fresh out of the oven when the 75 minutes are up. We recommend setting some time aside after class to brew your favorite coffee or tea—then take a cozy seat, savor your sweets, and fika like a real Swede.

55649,Divine Dish: Wild Mushroom Tortellini,"Legend has it that tortellini’s delightful shape was modeled on Venus’s navel, but chef Jannie Huang has another reason to call them “little pockets of love.” She’s crafted her recipe for tender, mushroom-filled pasta in sage beurre monté broth to warm your heart as it delights your tastebuds—and you’ll learn to make it like a culinary genius in this 90-minute experience.

Before class, you’ll prepare cashews or sunflower seeds for one of Jannie’s most intriguing ingredients—a creamy, vegan ricotta. Jannie will kick off the lesson by teaching you to make and shape the dough: Tortellini pasta has to be thin enough to fold, so you’ll need a pasta maker for this class (either electric or hand-crank will work just fine). Next, Jannie will show you how to turn wild mushrooms, spices, and the vegan cheese into a mouthwatering filling. Lastly, you’ll learn the chef’s secret of beurre monté, a sauce of melted butter (or vegan butter) that’ll add incomparable flavor to the traditional broth. In true Italian style, the tortellini will cook right in the broth and the sage-garnished delicacy will be ready to serve by the end of class.    

This experience is a scrumptious gift to yourself and anyone who loves learning new recipes and cooking techniques. It makes an especially creative date night for your partner or a favorite couple—with a dish this divine, the goddess of love herself is sure to approve.

55777,Make Some Room: Mindful Organization,"Maybe you’re swamped by stuff. Perhaps there’s one part of your home that always seems jam-packed with chaos. Or, you just want to get more organized…and stay that way. Wherever you are with your decluttering goals, this two-hour online experience with professional organizer Chernise Spruell will jumpstart your intentions and put you on the path to a more mindful—and less messy—way of living.

This class is an empowering gift to yourself or anyone who wants to begin their clutter-clearing journey. Chernise believes that cleaning up should feel good, so she takes a holistic approach that respects mind, body, and spirit. To stay focused, you’ll pick just one area that you want to work on during the session: a room, a closet, or even just a shelf (be sure you can take the class while you’re in—or close to—this location).

Chernise will begin by leading you in a guided visualization of how you want to feel in the space after it’s organized, and you’ll plan a reward for yourself to look forward to when you're done. She’ll walk you through her method of “ease-filled decluttering,” explain why you don’t need to purchase storage containers (yay!), and provide tips on navigating speedbumps. Then you and your online companions will dive into 45 minutes of real-time organizing, with Chernise on hand to answer questions and cheer you on.
 
When you regroup, you’ll share your experience and, most importantly, celebrate your progress. This class is a remarkable opportunity to be mentored by a decluttering expert and enjoy the support of a group as you learn organizing skills that you’ll be able to apply to many areas of your home—and your life.

55922,Artistic Escape: Summer Painting,"There was a time when painters like Winslow Homer and Jane Peterson flocked to seaside artist colonies every summer, drawn there by long days of crystal-clear light and stunning scenery. Your house (or terrace or backyard) will become your very own summertime artist’s utopia in this 90-minute class where instructor Jennifer Funnell will teach you to paint one of the seashore’s most beloved sights: a sun-drenched lighthouse. 

This class is a wonderfully creative date night for couples or mini-getaway with a bosom buddy. No prior art experience is required because you’ll be working with our Paint by Shadows Kit, which includes all the paint, brushes, and pre-printed artwork you’ll need (usually $45, it’s included in the price of this class). Jennifer will start with an introduction to the materials in your kit. Next, she’ll share the essentials of working with acrylic colors, including how to mix pigments to create new shades, fill in large areas, and add personal touches. Then you’re ready to brush away, with Jennifer on hand to answer questions as you go. 

Get that summer vacation feeling by bringing your favorite sparkling wine, sangria, or frozen cocktails—you can even make a playlist of music or ambient seaside sounds to listen to while you paint (with your Zoom muted, of course). You’ll probably finish your masterpiece during the 90 minutes, but you may want to leave time after class to keep on painting, just like those artists of yesteryear. When the days are this long and lovely, no one could blame you.

Experiences make great gifts! To gift this class, simply purchase the class for the date/time you think will work for your recipient. If that doesn’t work for the recipient, no worries! Send an email that includes your order confirmation number to help@uncommongoods.com at least 48-hours prior and we’ll help get them moved into a scheduled class that works better for them.

56089,Synch with the Moon: Lunar Astrology Class,"The moon may seem like the sun’s gentle little sibling, but its force of attraction is strong enough to draw the entire Earth toward its luminous self. It makes sense that a heavenly body with that kind of power can have a profound effect on our own fortunes as well. Join leading astrologer Emily Klintworth for an illuminating one-hour class where you’ll learn how to consciously connect with the cyclical energies of our silvery satellite.

This class is a captivating gift to anyone who's celebrating a birthday, contemplating a decision, or excited to learn about how the moon may impact their daily life. Before class, you’ll have two homework assignments: First, you’ll generate your moon chart using Emily’s moon calculator tool (you'll need to know the date, place, and exact time of your birth in order to create a chart that’s personalized for you). Then, you’ll unbox the beautiful Synch With the Moon Workbook that's included with your purchase of this class. Developed by Emily and designed by Uncommon Goods, it features a full year of moon charts and lunar-phase stickers in a spiral-bound format that you can hang up for daily consultation. 

During class, Emily will teach you to plot the moon in your astrological birth chart and analyze how it affects different areas of your life—relationships, finances, wellness, creativity, and more. She’ll explain how this work can support you in timing your actions, releasing negativity, and activating your potential. By the end of the hour, you’ll have learned how to come into alignment with the moon’s magnetic pull and gained the skills to chart its astrological influence for an entire year ahead (and many years to come).

Experiences make great gifts! To gift this class, simply purchase the class for the date/time you think will work for your recipient. If that doesn’t work for the recipient, no worries! Send an email that includes your order confirmation number to help@uncommongoods.com at least 48-hours prior and we’ll help get them moved into a scheduled class that works better for them.

55092,The BIGGIES Conversation Cards,"When you want your kids to get better at soccer, math, or music, you tell them to practice, right? But how can you help them work on skills that are harder to pin down, like dealing with stress or bouncing back after a disappointment? That was the question that Devin Tomiak and Dr. Amy Engelman set out to answer when they created this engaging deck.

Each of the 25 colorful cards tackles a big concept that teaches youngsters about emotional resilience: think forgiveness, patience, and perseverance. On the front, you’ll find a question that jump-starts the conversation, like “How do you feel after helping someone?” and “What happens when you listen closely?” Flip the card over for extra prompts that let you dig deeper into the subject. To keep things on-topic (and to give everyone a chance to talk), a special card designates just one speaker at a time. 

Little ones will think it’s a game, but you’ll know that they’re learning how to manage their emotions, relate positively to others, and make thoughtful choices while getting a boost in confidence and communication skills.

56092,Hanging Gardens: DIY Kokedama Class,"You love your juicy succulents and big leafy monstera, but you’re craving a new gardening challenge—or you just want to green-up your home with something that’s not the average potted plant. Meet kokedama: The word is Japanese for moss ball, and that’s exactly what it is. These self-contained live sculptures for growing plants may look like they require the skills of an expert gardener, but you’ll learn how to create your own with ease in this one-hour class. 

Almost any small plant can grow in a kokedama, so this class is a wonderful gift to someone who’ll be excited to learn a new style of gardening—and making these enchanting green microcosms is also a relaxing and creative pastime. Your teacher is Savannah Barkley, creator of the Hanging Kokedama Ball Kit that’s included with your purchase of the class. Savannah will start the hour with some background on the art of kokedama as she explains what’s in your kit. Then, she’ll walk you through the process of turning moss, soil, and twine into your very first kokedama: a petite hanging umbrella plant. Finally, you’ll learn how to display and care for your creation and Savannah will answer any questions you have. When the hour is up, you’ll have made a work of living art and found a delightful new way to bring a bit of the outdoors to your indoor space.

51260,Play the Patriarchy,"You know that game where someone draws a card and then everyone tries to match it with the funniest, dirtiest, and most disturbing thing? This game is kinda like that, but if it were created by a bunch of hilarious women. Because it was. Developed by the team at the feminist satire website Reductress, Play the Patriarchy is based on some of their most attention-grabbing articles. To play, pick a matriarch to pull a prompt and judge players’ answers. Everyone else then matches as many subject, verb, and descriptor cards as they can to the prompt to make a sentence they think the matriarch will choose above the rest. For example, if the prompt is “Too real” you might choose cards to build the sentence “Literally” “at a bar” “at 7 a.m.” and a prompt reading “Name of a book, probably” could lead to “New age friend” “going to yoga” “living their best life” “but with oat milk.”  Players take turns as the matriarch, and in the end, the player who’s used the most prompt cards wins. (Warning: These examples are pretty tame compared to some in the bunch. Get ready to blush, face palm, and laugh... a lot.)

Back home, they prototyped, tweaked, and tested until they came up with a straw fine enough to filter coffee, but without the clogging. It's great at home and even better on the go. To use, just put ground coffee in your cup, add hot water, steep, and drink. Not just legendary: genius. Designed by Joey Jones and Nick Yehle.

52852,Vertical Urban Garden Planters - Set of 5,"Bryan Meador came up with the idea for these ingenious planters while walking through an industrial area near his home that’s “covered in chain-link fences and littered with plastic bottles.” He began to dream of greenifying the desolate space and similar ones in any city.

Fill each with a gallon of soil, grow whatever you like, and beautify your neighborhood while simultaneously taking direct action to fight climate change.

56377,Trade Secrets: Coffee Tasting Class,"There was a time when you had only one decision to make about coffee: regular or decaf. Now we can choose from a sumptuous range of varieties, origins, and roasts…but how many of us really know what we’re looking for in an extraordinary cup of joe? Join professional roaster, brewer, and taster James McCarthy for a 75-minute online class where you’ll discover secrets to tasting and appraising coffee the way the experts do.

Like wine and whiskey, coffee has distinct characteristics that anyone can learn to distinguish, so this class is an exciting gift for those who love coffee or café culture—and it’s especially fun to share with a friend or partner. You’ll be working with the Blind Taste Test Coffee Kit that comes with your purchase of this class: It includes five hand-selected coffees from around the world, sampling cups, tasting forms, and a detailed flavor wheel. James will introduce you to the side-by-side cupping technique that pros use to evaluate beans and brews. As the five varieties steep in their cups, James will explain the importance of coffee’s ""terroir,"" which includes everything from growing conditions to cultural influences. Next, he’ll show you how to sample like a savant: breaking the “crust” to release the heavenly aroma, and using two spoons for five rounds of tasting. 

You’ll identify and discuss subtle notes of fragrance, body, and flavor, like dark chocolate, blackberry, and cinnamon. Then comes the big reveal, when James shares the origin and profile of each sample, and you find out how closely your own appraisal matches the real thing. By the end of class, you’ll understand and appreciate coffee in a whole new way, and you’ll have the know-how to choose the brews that will make every cup more satisfying than ever.

Experiences make great gifts! To gift this class, simply purchase the class for the date/time you think will work for your recipient. If that doesn’t work for the recipient, no worries! Send an email that includes your order confirmation number to help@uncommongoods.com at least 48-hours prior and we’ll help get them moved into a scheduled class that works better for them. Please note: By default, order confirmations and event details are sent to the purchaser’s email.

56487,Happy Jams: Play the Ukulele,"Although you can trace its origins to Portugal’s guitar-like branguinha, the ukulele first became a sensation in the 19th century across the Hawaiian Islands. Its inimitable sound has been associated with that Pacific paradise ever since, which must explain why it stirs up such instant feel-good vibes. When just listening to the ukulele sparks a smile, think how much fun you’ll have strumming those sweet strings yourself—and you’ll learn how in this delightful 90-minute class with well-known instructor Jacob Sayraf (a.k.a., Ukulele Jake). 

Jake has toured around the world performing and introducing students of all ages to the joy of uke. No musical experience is needed: Just bring your own instrument and, as Jake says, “a pocketful of dreams.” He’ll kick things off by showing you how to tune up and then you’ll get right into it, learning to shape the basic chords that become actual melodies. “No pomp and circumstance,” is Jake’s approach. “You come to learn how to play and sing some songs, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.” 

This experience is an amazing gift that's especially fun to share with a friend or give to a couple, family members, and anyone who wants to get in touch with their musical side. By the end of class, you’ll have learned three whole songs and the basics that’ll let you play many more. While we don’t guarantee that you can strum your way to happiness, this is a pretty good place to start. 

Experiences make great gifts! To gift this class, simply purchase the class for the date/time you think will work for your recipient. If that doesn’t work for the recipient, no worries! Send an email that includes your order confirmation number to help@uncommongoods.com at least 48-hours prior and we’ll help get them moved into a scheduled class that works better for them.

This experience is a mouthwatering gift for anyone who loves to discover new recipes for family faves. Before class, you’ll learn how to turn cashew and macadamia nuts into 100% vegan cheese (you’re free to use your favorite ricotta if you prefer). LisaMarie will kick off the class by showing you how to make the dough, and you’ll have an assist from the Gourmet Pizza Dough Gift Set that’s included in your purchase of this class. It comes with three specially blended mixes that just need water to make pizzeria-worthy crust (you’ll use one of them in class, and you’ll have the other two to experiment with whenever you like).   

Next, you’ll prepare the toppings: panko-crusted eggplant for the savory pizza, and a maple syrup–flavored chocolate-hazelnut spread for the sweet pie. Once they’re in the oven, LisaMarie will answer your questions, and both of your pizzas will be ready to enjoy just a few minutes after the end of class. Dinner and dessert, easy as pie.

The player then shares the memory conjured by the three cards with the group.

Unlike acupuncture, it can start to alleviate pain instantly rather than after hours on a masseuse table. Who knows, it could even replace that headache with zen contemplations. Made in California.

Here are the basics: Everyone starts with three cards and takes turns putting one into the discard pile, but it has to match in either color or food. If you don’t have a matching card, draw a card from the deck until you find one you can play. All the cards you don’t play go into your Poop pile. You can also play an action card (with such whimsical characters as Pooperman and Farty Godmother) to flush your Poop or send it to other players. The game ends when the deck runs out, and the player with the least Poop wins! There are also two variations for younger or more advanced players, so everyone 5+ can enjoy a thoroughly uncouth game night.

53341,Heirloom Custom Video Book,"It might be baby's first birthday, Christmas morning, or graduation day.

There are so many reasons to share videos, especially with older family members, but what if they don't know how to play them or don't have the right equipment? It's all good--with Ashley Kenny and Zack Bloom's new video book, you can send the most special moments to anyone. 

Ashley and Zack came up with the idea for a video book when they wanted to send home movies to their 92-year-old grandma, Fran, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their invention couldn't be easier to use: All the recipient has to do is open the book. It arrives fully charged and playback begins instantly with nothing to download, no buttons to push, and no need for WiFi or an internet connection. The video will play for up to one hour, and recharging is simple with the included USB cable.

How It Works

You'll receive an email with a redemption link to help you design your book. Follow this link to the customization website where you'll drag-and-drop up to 20 minutes of video from your phone, tablet, or desktop's library. Pick a pretty book cover, enter the name and address of the recipient, check out, and you're done. You can also personalize your book with a recorded greeting and a printed note inside the front cover. Video book made in China with components from China and the US.

46648,Benevolent Brownies,"Guilty pleasures? Not these brownies. Sure, they're sinfully rich: classic chocolate fudge, vegan fudge, brown sugar blondie with chocolate chips, and snickerdoodle. But go ahead and treat yourself: every bite helps a baker's dozen of social programs flourish. Founded by a Buddhist in 1982, Greyston Bakery, a fellow B Corp, hires workers who typically wouldn't be hired by most companies because of their past or present circumstanceswith no questions asked. Employees, instead, prove themselves on the job. A range of resources, including child care, community gardens, workforce development, and sustainability programs, helps support their efforts. The chance to have a stable income while developing their knowledge and skills has transformed many employees' lives, and helped alleviate some of the poverty of the Yonkers community. Of course, none of this would work if people didn't crave their baked goods like crazywhich they (and we) do. (They baked our founder's wedding cake.) But don't just take it from us: Ben & Jerry's (another fellow B Corp) uses only these brownies in its ice cream. Baked with love in New York State.

47184,Living Composter,"The happiest, healthiest plants ever—that'll be the end result of feeding food scraps to the worms in this sculptural compost container. Most worm farms look, if we're being polite, functional. And most compost containers, in tactful terms, do not smell like roses. This one, cool-looking and odorless, raises the bar on both counts. The designers of this biomorphic worm house collected data for almost two years, then created an algorithm to figure out the best shape for both worm health and human convenience. Drop fruit and vegetable peelings, grain foods, and tea bags into a top opening. The worms-in-residence will eat at least half of their own weight of scraps per day. The composter can process over two pounds of food a week, enough to keep up with most or all of the scraps in a two- or three-person household. Spread the easily removed compost next to your plants or in pots, and watch those babies grow.Worm castings (a fancy word for the worm equivalent of manure) are the best natural fertilizer there is. They're packed with water-soluble plant nutrients, beneficial enzymes and microbes, and improves soil's ability to hold moisture. So potent is vermicompost that as little as a tablespoon could feed a 6 inch potted plant for over two months. Worms not included. Made in Taiwan.

Consider the inner disk your actual message, the outer disk the secret message.

Renée combines her affinity for the geometric patterning used in textiles, mosaics, and stained glass to create personal home and building portraits that depict not only what she saw in a particular location, but, more significantly, what she felt.

Beachside, and A Sunset to Remember were all painted while vacationing on the Gulf Coast of Florida with a friend's family.  The group had traveled south from Illinois by station wagon, audio recording their quirky adventure--staying only at roadside motels, eating at old-time diners, visiting the local restaurants and historical sites along the way.  The road trip ended at the pristine white sandy beaches of the Panhandle of Florida, where the travelers drank sweet tea, snorkeled the crystal blue waters of the Gulf Coast and enjoyed delicious southern peach milkshakes.

Here, Hofeldt’s near-photorealist touch shines in her depiction of a stout white-and-blue ceramic gravy boat, while her jocular spirit comes forward in the stark, triangular shark’s fin that springs from it.

For her underwater scene, she picked natural materials from the earth itself—her home in the Catskills, to be exact. She researched leaves and tropical plants to find those that most mimicked the look of underwater foliage, selecting individual leaves for their color or texture.

40901,Cannabis Americana,"Up until its prohibition in 1937, Cannabis was the third most used compound in medicine for sixty years running. Indica, a strain imported from India, was thought to be the superior medicinal option but inconsistent supply required the U.S. to develop its own strain. After a collaboration between pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly & Co and Parke-Davis & Co in the 1890's, an improved variety called Cannabis Americana came on the market in the form of herbal materials and tinctures-liquid extracts that kept cannabinoids in their raw, physiologically inactive state.The glass apothecary bottles themselves were something of a work of art-hand-lettered labels reverse painted and affixed to a recessed panel using yellow wax and rosin. Made in Millville, New Jersey, this flint glass bottle was designed for frequent use and stands 12.25 inches tall, including the blown glass stopper. This particular bottle shows its longevity with the careful repair of a small crack in the letter C on its left side.Industry pioneer Don Wirtshafter was inspired to collect the remaining historical evidence of the use of Cannabis as a medicine. Eager to curate and present images of this obscure, yet increasingly relevant era, he teamed with historian and paper and textile preservationist Paul MacFarland. The two then partnered with CannabisMuseum.com to bring the bottles and their medicinal use back into the limelight—the result is a piece of history that continues to gain relevance and importance today.Here, a part of their collection is photographed in stunning detail by Ohio-based photographer David Hooker. Set against a backdrop of a 13-star, colonial-style flag made in the early 20th century, this image serves as both an educational and intriguing touch of history for your home. Made in Oregon.

The two then partnered with CannabisMuseum.com to bring the bottles and their medicinal use back into the limelight- the result is a piece of history that continues to gain relevance and importance today.Here, a part of their collection is photographed in stunning detail by Ohio-based photographer David Hooker. Set against a simple black backdrop, this image serves as both an educational and intriguing touch of history for your home. Made in Oregon.

Tim rescues them from forgotten retirement (and landfills) by adding electric lamp innards, a cherry wood base, and a black shade. The shade's reflective gold foil lining creates a beautiful glow on the blue glass when the lamp is switched on. Kind of like the nostalgic glow of the past, when seen from the present.

49768,World's Fair by Mort Gerberg,"""This was my first cartoon in The New Yorker,"" Mort Gerberg says about his 1965 illustration. ""The Beatniks in Washington Square Park were the forerunners of protesters who didn't like that the World's Fair would be taking over Queens, and it was the beginning of the Civil Rights movement. So it seemed like a particular coming together of what was going on at the time.""Known for his clever mix of wit and social commentary, Mort has been a working cartoonist for more than half a century. ""World's Fair"" is one in a series of limited edition prints we're offering (just 10 of each), numbered and signed by him with the same pen he uses to draw. Framed in solid obeche wood with a double-thick mat, it's a gift for the person who enjoys art with a wink. Printed and framed in Oregon.

50220,Tofu Press,"When you press the water out of raw bean curd, two magical things happen: It sucks up more marinade, and gets way crispier when you fry it. (This is the secret to incredible tofu that’s tender in the center, with a well-seasoned, crisp crust.) Soy-squeezing-wise, Marta Cornwell's clever polished press design is about as simple (and handsome) as it gets. Set the press on a dish or in the sink for drainage, place a block of tofu inside, and lower the 4.5-pound weight onto it. Over the next 15-20 minutes, the weight squeezes and the water drains as you prep the rest of the meal. And now it’s a blank canvas for creating crave-tastic flavor and texture.

We're referencing elephants, zebras, and giraffes at the ol' watering hole, but the scenarios are actually pretty similar. Make the spot where friends meet around food and drink a wild one, with these meticulously hand-carved snack dishes.  Kenyan artisans craft each bowl from a solid block of jacaranda wood—either recovered from naturally fallen trees or cut to clear roads. Using techniques passed down for generations, they cut rough shapes, then refine details using chisels and other hand tools. Once the bowls and their animal adornments are carved, each undergoes a series of sandings with increasingly finer grit paper before getting dried in the sun. (Unless it's the rainy season, then they're dried in a small room heated by burning wood shavings and other offcuts leftover from the carving process.) Finally, every bowl is painted by hand.  All of this is done in a small workshop in Kiambu, just north of Nairobi National Park, where the Kenyan wildlife that inspired these designs roam free.",30.0,"[30.0, 30.0]",https://www.uncommongoods.com/images/items/48800/48847_1_360px.jpg,https://www.uncommongoods.com,,https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/safari-snack-bowls

56103,Personal Wine Glass Chiller,"What do a chardonnay, Riesling, and rosé have in common? They all taste their best when cooled, and many reds reach peak flavor at a wine-cellar temp of around 60°F. But even the most perfectly chilled pour doesn’t stay that way once it’s out of the bottle. With Lisa and Randall Pawlik’s clever creation, your favorite vintage keeps its cool—and flavor—much longer. 

Here’s how it works: Chill the “cradle” in the freezer for at least three hours and attach it to the stand (a magnet holds it tight). Then, place a stemmed wine glass in the cradle, pour, and enjoy. The frozen piece cools your wine to an optimal temperature for up to an hour and a half indoors and 45 minutes in a shady outdoor spot, and you don’t have to compromise taste with a metal chilling wand or plastic ice balls. If your drink’s too cold, just let the glass rest outside of the cradle for a few minutes. Choose from four soft, neutral shades to complement your table and decor. Made in Texas.

You can start harvesting in four weeks, and each plant capsule guarantees regular harvest for four to six months.

49408,Pre-Prohibition Cocktail Syrups,"What's in a bottle of tonic water? Sure, there's quinine, but there's also gross stufflike high fructose corn syrup. Collective shudder. When flavor buff Tory Pratt learned what horrors lurked within the modern mixer, she set out to do a little research on how the OG drink was made. Years later, these delectable pre-prohibition-style syrups are the fruits of her labor. Try her tonic with gin and a splash of club soda for a fresher take on a classic, complete with fragrant citrusy notes. The grenadine, made with real pomegranate, makes a vibrant addition to Tequila Sunrises, and a little of her rich, caramelly take on a simple syrup goes a long way. (One bottle of the dark, double-simmered elixir holds enough to make 32 Old Fashioneds.) Lovers of history and booze alike will appreciate Tory's exhaustive research.

Inside, you'll find five single-origin, expertly roasted coffees from around the world and a step-by-step guide to the professional “cupping” technique. This is a blind test, so you won’t have any info on the varieties you’re sampling—you’ll sip each one and make your own appraisal with help from the included flavor wheel. When you’re done, you’ll break the seal on the “Do Not Open!” envelope to see how close you came to each sample’s actual origin and profile. Even if it turns out that you don’t have the palate of a trained coffee connoisseur, you’ll still gain so much know-how that you’ll be able to identify the roasts and flavor notes that can lead you to your dream beans.

54257,Indigenous American Yaupon Holly Tea Trio,"Turn over a new leaf (literally) in your beverage lineup with three new teas, all made from yaupon holly. It’s the only caffeinated plant that’s native to the United States—in fact, cultivation and consumption of the tea by Indigenous Americans dates back more than 8,000 years. Yaupon is a lot like the tea you know and love, full of antioxidants and about a third of the caffeine in coffee, but without bitter tannins, so the taste is nice and smooth. The set comes with three delicious flavors:

American Green: Made purely from yaupon holly, this tea has a light-bodied, crisp taste with grassy notes.
Florida Chai: With a base of yaupon holly, this blend features warming spices, like organic cinnamon, clove, ginger, cardamom, and peppercorns.
Revive Mint: Pure yaupon holly and organic peppermint make for a smooth, crisp, refreshing taste.

Each of these teas is certified organic and packed with care in Florida. Scan the QR code on each one to see how it’s produced. Made in Edgewater, Florida.

Indigenous Americans have used yaupon holly as an important food, medicinal, and ceremonial item for thousands of years. With respect for that tradition, this brand of tea contributes to North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems (NATIFS) and the Indigenous Food Lab founded by Chef Sean Sherman, a.k.a. the Sioux Chef. It’s also distributed by Sweetgrass Trading, which is wholly-owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, and through Eufaula Indian Community Distributors in the Mvskoke Nation of Oklahoma.",30.0,"[30.0, 30.0]",https://www.uncommongoods.com/images/items/54200/54257_1_360px.jpg,https://www.uncommongoods.com,,https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/indigenous-american-yaupon-holly-tea-trio

Poured into recently emptied rye whiskey barrels, the aged syrup draws in the essence of the spicy spirit without the alcohol. Pour over ice cream or mix into whiskey cocktails.

The cardamom-infused syrup features organic spice from Guatemala. Incorporate into cake glazes, crepes, and cocktails.

Infused with organic spices from Vietnam and Madagascar, the cinnamon and vanilla syrup pairs well with apple pie or yogurt. Try stirring some into a glass of milk for a sublime nightcap. 

The elderberry syrup is woodsy with an intense flavor reminiscent of honey and figs. It pairs well with cheese, mixed into yogurt, or drizzled over pound cake. 

This set of four enticing syrups is beautifully packaged and handmade in Cambridge, Vermont.

43041,Barrel Aged Vermont Maple Syrup,"Maple syrup, bourbon, and rum are three of the most delicious liquids found in the Americas. But Americans know there's always a way to make something delicious even more so (hello, chocolate-dipped potato chips). When environmental advocates Eric and Laura Sorkin  moved from our nation's capital to Vermont to become organic farmers, they began tinkering with syrup from the sugar maples behind their house. Pouring it into barrels used for aging bourbon and rum and letting flavors mingle for a few months turned out to be a capital idea.
Laura's degree from the French Culinary Institute came in handy as she developed recipes using their syrups for desserts, cocktails, and savory dishes (there's a link to a couple of them below). And the couple's concern for the environment led them to become one of the first maple operations to be certified as bird-friendly by the National Audubon Society. (Conventional maple syrup farming often harms the natural habitat.)

24258,Himalayan Salt BBQ Plank,"Looking to spice up your culinary life? This hand-carved platter of Himalayan salt is your multi-tasking tool to do just that. Its beauty and unique properties will allow you to present and even cook your food in ways that will delight your tongue and dazzle your dinner guests. 

Himalayan salt has a very stable crystal structure, which allows it to hold a temperature very well. You can chill it to use as a serving platter for sushi, or heat it over a grill or stovetop to cook your veggies. Cooking on salt gives it a greatly enhanced flavor over that of a frying pan. The mineral content in the salt gives it a more nuanced flavor than table salt, and the amount of saltiness it imparts varies with the type of food (moist foods absorb more salt, fatty foods repel it, etc.). Himalayan salt is also long-lasting and naturally antibiotic, needing little more than wiping with a damp sponge after most uses. Whatever you're serving up, you will be sure to do so with greater flavor and flair.  Hand-carved in Pakistan.

It's tricky enough to give your brain a workout—and pretty enough to leave on the coffee table between problem-solving sessions. Gather your geekiest pals and/or your mathematically-minded kids and let the challenge begin. Made in China.

It’s believed that by gently triggering specific spots, we can release the flow of energy to help with mindfulness, stress relief, mental clarity, energy, and relaxation.

Choose from three crystals: obsidian, said to aid in recognizing and releasing stressful mental patterns; 
carnelian, said to increase energy, strength, and vitality; and tiger iron, said to promote self-healing, encourage personal power, and sustain mental clarify.

(For instance, the 19th Amendment, which passed in 1920, only technically gave all female U.S. citizens the right to vote; in reality, Indigenous and Black Americans of both genders were very often prevented from exercising that right for many decades afterward.) This coffee table book celebrates those who dared to stand for equal rights through a collection of New York Times articles, which begins with the Equal Rights Convention in 1866 and ends with the Time's Up movement in 2018. The cover features an image from Washington D.C.'s women's march, where, in the crowd of hundreds of thousands, ""mothers marched with daughters and granddaughters,"" wrote the Times, ""whole families, including husbands and sons, marched arm in arm."" Introduction written by New York Times Gender Issues Editor Susan Chira. Made in Williston, Vermont.

With their easy-to-learn game, you and up to five friends take turns sampling and guessing mystery bottles and unlocking “cellar doors” as you progress through the board. No special knowledge is necessary: You only need a passion for wine and a desire to enjoy it on a deeper level.

Whether it's a childhood favorite made just for you, a holiday feast, or dinner at that off-the-beaten-path bistro, there’s probably a talented woman behind those memorable meals. And yet it’s easy to take for granted the role that women play in our culinary lives, whether we’re at home, out on the town, or gathering with friends and family.

In this empowering (and long-overdue) celebration of women who cook, Lindsay Gardner has curated a remarkable collection of interviews, essays, and—of course—recipes. She’s brought together more than 100 chefs, restaurateurs, writers, activists, and home cooks to reveal the power of food to nourish and inspire. Lindsay takes us to meet intriguing women who are dishing it out around the world, from an Afro-Indigenous farm in upstate New York, to an Indian family’s dinner table in Dallas, Texas, and a small-but-mighty Parisian apartment kitchen. Beautifully illustrated with Lindsay’s lively watercolors, this is a book to gift to all the cooks, bakers, foodies, and feminists who feed us—body and soul.

You can also use it for squats, push-ups, or plenty of other exercises detailed in the digital guide. By simply maintaining stability, you’ll engage your whole body (but especially your core), building additional strength and burning more calories than if you were doing the same exercises on a flat surface. It’s just the thing to take your home (or backyard, garage, park, etc.) workouts to the next level. Handmade in North Carolina.

Both bars also feature refreshing and energizing scents—the Honey Pilsner Soap Bar smells like raw honey and pine, while the Citrus IPA Soap Bar smells like citrus fruits and dry florals.

53289,Couple's Split Blanket & Sheet Set,"Snoozing with your sweetheart should be like a slumber party, not a tug-of-war. That’s why Merideth and John Jaskowski designed their clever sheet set with a flat sheet that’s split from the top down to the not-quite-bottom. It stays securely tucked at the foot of the bed, allowing you and your resident cuddle buddy to customize your sides. Alleged cover hogs can get good and snuggly while the hottest of sleepers can cool off, neither one disturbing the other. Plus, it’s 4"" wider than the typical sheet, ensuring each partner has plenty of wiggle room. But it’s not just for twosomes—the split means singletons will only have half the bed to make in the morning.

Each brass-dipped, hanging instrument offers an analog method of establishing the current time. The Astronomical Rings use your position in relation to the sun to cast a ray of light through the device onto its timekeeping dials. When darkness falls, the Nocturlabe determines the hour and minute by aligning with stars found in the Big Dipper and Little Dipper.

53756,Bioluminescent Octopus Orb,"All over the world, there are places where nature puts on a spectacular underwater light show after dark. Now you don’t have to trek to a distant lagoon at just the right time of year to be awed by the phenomenon. The water in this crystal ball gets its uncanny blue shimmer from dinoflagellates—nope, they’re not tiny swimming dinosaurs (although that would be adorable), they’re a form of marine algae that naturally illuminates all on its own. 

Pour the pouch of California seawater into the handblown glass sphere and place it on the intricately detailed octopus stand. Leave it in a moderately lit spot during the day, and when darkness falls, give the orb a gentle swirl to see the exquisite incandescence come to life. The illumination will fade as the water settles: just shake the orb again to light up the night. Feed the dinos every one to two weeks with the included nutrient water, and you’ll have luminous nighttime color for up to six months, with refill packs available to keep the glow going even longer.

54302,Preschool Time Teaching Watches,"We give kids booster seats, bikes with training wheels, and their own menus at restaurants. So when it comes to teaching them how to tell time, it only makes sense to do it on their  terms. That's why Lauren Vantuykom designed this watch that uses colors (hours) and glow-in-the-dark animals (minutes) in place of numbers. The idea is to teach preschool-age kids the concept of time first, before moving on to actual numbers, by using things already familiar to them. So instead of saying ""We'll leave at 4:30"" (which doesn't mean much to an excited 4-year-old), you can explain you'll leave when the small hand is on pink and the big hand is on the frog. Who knows? In time, they may even discover the virtue of patience.

Each watch features a Japanese quartz movement, and is shock- and water-resistant (though can't be worn while swimming). The flexible silicone band features your choice of either unicorns and rainbows or trucks and construction gear.

42133,Foot Sole Massage,"This rock-and-roll reflexology set will be music to your feet. A way to give yourself an effective foot massage, the smooth soapstone balls can be used heated for just a quick few minutes at home to provide relaxation and relief to tired feet. Place one ball at a time in the cork base and, while sitting, massage the most tender points of the soles of your feet. Made in Finland.
FAQ's:
Can they be washed?
The stone balls can be cleaned either in a dish washer or by hand.
If necessary, you can clean the cork base by hand, with a little soap and water. Allow the cork to dry completely before using it next time.
Use:
In order to be effective the stones used in this kind of therapy have to stay warm for long period of time. The amazing heat retaining capacity of Finnish soapstone has been used for centuries. These therapy stones have been crafted from this, over two billion years old, unique natural stone.
Heat:
Place the soapstone balls at the bottom of a small, heat-resistant bowl. Pour hot water over the stones until they are completely submerged.
When the water has cooled so that you can safely place your hand in it, remove one of the balls from the bowl. Leave the other ball in the water, so that it stays warm. Dry the surface of the stone and, when still warm, place it in the shallow recess in the cork base. 
Place the cork base on the floor. Sit in a relaxed position and massage the tender areas on the sole of your foot, either cross-wise or along the length of the foot. 
After massaging one foot, exchange the ball in the cork base for a new, warm one and repeat the process for your other foot.
The combination of warmth and pressure is extremely relaxing and pleasant. Warmth conveyed via the feet reaches the entire body.  You may also perform a foot massage without warming the stones.",38.0,"[38.0, 38.0]",https://www.uncommongoods.com/images/items/42100/42133_1_360px.jpg,https://www.uncommongoods.com/images/items/42100/42133_2_360px.jpg,,https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/foot-sole-massage

25880,Wishing Ball,"Where do wishes go once you make them? Their force for good travels out into the universe in ways we don't understand, but what if you could keep a piece behind as a special reminder of that magic?

Glass artist Jill Henrietta Davis has conjured up a way to do just that. Each shimmering ball of hand-blown, blue glass comes with 52 tiny slips of paper for you to pause once a week throughout the year and record a message of hope or gratitude. Coil them up and tuck them in the tiny hole near the base and they become a permanent part of the display. 

People often ask Jill why the wishes can't come back out, and her explanation can be summed up with birthday candles. When you blow out your candles, you don't tell the wish you made, otherwise it won't come true, says Jill. But more importantly, memories are always more beautiful than photographs, and the same is true of wishes. When you look at the little slips of paper accumulating in your Wishing Ball, I want you to think about the Big Picture those messages convey. Rereading the notes would be like looking backwards, or trying to step in the same river twice. Handmade in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

26446,Birthstone Wishing Balls,"Your birthday is like a private New Year's celebration—a chance to reflect and look forward to the milestones you plan on reaching in the year to come. With this sentiment in mind, Jill Henrietta Davis created her birthstone wishing ball to capture a single wish, accomplishment, or meditation every week for the coming year. Each shimmering ball of hand-blown glass comes with 52 tiny slips of paper for you to pause once a week throughout the year and record a message of hope or gratitude. Coil them up and tuck them in the tiny hole near the base and they become a permanent part of the display. 

People often ask Jill why the wishes can't come back out, and she explains in terms of birthday candles: ""When you blow out your candles, you don't tell the wish you made, otherwise it won't come true. But more importantly, memories are always more beautiful than photographs, and the same is true of wishes. When you look at the little slips of paper accumulating in your Wishing Ball, I want you to think about the big picture those messages convey. Rereading the notes would be like looking backwards, or trying to step in the same river twice."" Available in twelve vibrant hues that correspond to each month's birthstone.
