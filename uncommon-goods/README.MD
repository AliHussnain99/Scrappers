  "description": "Picasso worked in oils when he was 8. A young Frida Kahlo filled notebooks with sketches. Who knows what spark these colorful kits could ignite in your little artist? Brittany and Ashley Silfies have brought together everything kids need to start painting, including nontoxic, premixed colors, four brushes, and a clearly numbered 8\" x 10\" canvas that you can frame when each magnum opus is completed. Even if you suspect that you don't have a prodigy in the house, your child will still enjoy hours of creative, screen-free playtimeâ€”a stroke of genius all on its own. Choose from a gallery of three easy-to-paint designs: Dino, Llama, and Dog. Designed in Birmingham, Alabama. Made in China.",
